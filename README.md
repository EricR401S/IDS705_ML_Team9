The problem of fake profiles on Dating Apps such as Tinder and Bumble is a serious issue that can deceive and scam users. The use of AI-generated photos to create fake profiles is a growing concern, with some individuals using them innocently due to disinterest or shyness, while others have malicious intentions.

## Data

The Flickr FacesHQ dataset contains 70,000 high-quality PNG images of human faces at 1024 x 1024 resolution, while the 1 million fake faces dataset contains artificially generated images. Both datasets exhibit variation in age, ethnicity. For our application space, it will be used to train and test a model for detecting fake images, with a focus on understanding the model's limitations and generalizability. The model will be tested on a typical dating profile faces to develop metrics for detecting fake user profiles. The dataset was manually curated to avoid legal and ethical concerns related to scraping profile images from dating apps. The goal is to understand the practicality and generalizability of future facial classification tools through these insights.
